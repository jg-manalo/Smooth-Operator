# Game Mechanics
---
* Make sure you not crash into the spawning enemy car
* Game's difficulty increases as the enemy car sped up based on the score you are hitting
* Score checkpoints:
    * 1000  - unlocks the music, thus the music is played in a loop
    * 5000  - friction is depleted by half
    * 23000 - friction is also depleted by half
    * 50000 - friction is also depleted by half
      * _Imagine the friction is at 32 units at the start, when it reaches certain score it decrements by its half all throughout_
